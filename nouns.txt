Greenhouse gas reduction account
            
Preamble
Human-induced climate change is real and impacts are being experienced around the globe. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that warming of the climate is unequivocal and that most of the observed increase in global average temperature is due to human activity.
To prevent dangerous climate change, the global community has identified the objectives of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.  A rise beyond 2 degrees Celsius poses the very real risk that countries around the world will experience irreversible damage to their environment.  Such a rise in temperature poses a risk of irreversible widespread impacts on human and natural systems and threatens Ontario’s agricultural resources, natural areas and ecosystems, and economic well-being.
This risk justifies action to mitigate climate change, including reducing greenhouse gas that causes climate change. The global community is mobilizing around this goal through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its related agreements, and Ontario is committed to playing its part.
By taking action now, Ontario’s households and communities, infrastructure, agricultural resources, natural areas and ecosystems, including the Great Lakes and the boreal forest, will be better protected for the benefit and enjoyment of all. Ontario will also be well positioned to take advantage of the low-carbon economy through local job creation, an expanding low-carbon technology sector and other global economic opportunities.
All Ontarians have a role to play in addressing climate change, including understanding how Ontarians contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and changing their behaviour to reduce those emissions.
The Government of Ontario believes that the public interest requires a broad effort to reduce greenhouse gas and to build a cleaner and more prosperous Province. The Government will continue to involve and engage individuals, businesses, communities, municipalities, non-governmental organizations and First Nation and Métis communities in the ultimate goal of fostering a high-productivity low-carbon economy and society in Ontario.
First Nation and Métis communities have a special relationship with the environment and are deeply connected spiritually and culturally to the land, water, air and animals.  They may offer their traditional ecological knowledge as the Government of Ontario develops specific actions.
The Government of Ontario cannot address this challenge alone. Collective action is required. As a leading sub-national jurisdiction, Ontario will participate in the international response to reduce greenhouse gas by establishing a carbon price. A key purpose of this Act is to establish a broad carbon price through a cap and trade program that will change the behaviour of everyone across the Province, including spurring low-carbon innovation. A cap and trade program in Ontario will allow Ontario to link to other regional cap and trade markets as part of the international, national and interprovincial responses to reduce greenhouse gas.
In addition to the carbon price signal and to further support the reduction of greenhouse gas, the Government of Ontario will pursue complementary actions to support and promote the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Enabled and supported by the cap and trade program and related actions, the Government of Ontario envisions, by 2050, a thriving society generating fewer or zero greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses and innovators will be creating world-leading low-carbon technologies and products that drive new economic growth, productivity and job creation. Ontarians will live, work and travel in sustainable ways in healthier and more liveable communities.
Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
